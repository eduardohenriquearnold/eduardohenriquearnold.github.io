abstract = "This paper describes the development of an industrial safety system that requires automatic human detection. Two solutions based on top-view depth images are presented. The first one is based on traditional learning techniques using feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The second solution uses deep learning methods for classification. The performance analysis of both solutions revealed that the deep learning methods outperform traditional learning techniques on this task, at the cost of requiring a larger training set and increased computational cost."
