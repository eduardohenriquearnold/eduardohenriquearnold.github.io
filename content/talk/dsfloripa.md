A short talk about a project I took part during my internship at Instituto SENAI de Tecnologia and which was also my final year project for my undergraduate program. My contribution was to elaborate an automatic human detection system for complex industrial environments. We used depth images from a overhead camera position to perform detection.

Two approaches to the detection problem were implemented and evaluated: traditional learning algorithms with manual feature extraction and deep learning classifiers. During this talk I revealed details and tradeoffs of both methods as well as a quantitative evaluation of their performance.
