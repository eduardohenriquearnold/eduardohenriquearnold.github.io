This talk was presented with my colleague Dr Graham Lee who is a lead engineer with the Intelligent Vehicles group at WMG.
Autonomous vehicles are set to transform the worldwide economy. This presentation will highlight the challenges and opportunities in the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. Exploring the role of connectivity between vehicles and infrastructure is key to achieve full autonomy. Novel research in platooning, cooperative perception and trajectory negotiation will be discussed along with methods for testing and validation of autonomous driving functions.
