A presentation introducing computer vision concepts and show how one can easily develop interesting applications such as augmented reality with Python. It was focused on implementation details for developers and was presented together with William Jamir Silva.

The code can be divided into two sections, one focusing on computer vision and another on computer graphics. The first one uses image processing algorithms to extract the position and identification of markers put in front of a camera. The latter one uses such information to render 3D models over the marker in the image in real time.
