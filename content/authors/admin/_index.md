I'm a Machine Learning Engineer working on visual relocalisation at [Niantic](https://nianticlabs.com/). Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Warwick, in the [Intelligent Vehicles group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/cav/), and was supervised by Mehrdad Dianati and Paul Jennings. My research focused on perception methods for autonomous driving, including cooperative 3D object detection, point cloud registration and sensor pose optimisation.
