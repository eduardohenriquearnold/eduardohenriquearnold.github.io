I'm a PhD candidate with the [Intelligent Vehicles group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/cav/) at the University of Warwick. My research is focused on perception methods for autonomous driving, including cooperative 3D object detection, point cloud registration and sensor pose optimisation.
